# PH Pets

**I have 2 cats, 2 fishies, 5 birds, *****used to have 2 rabbits ;w;*****, 2 hampters.**

##  Cats

### Timide

Timide is the oldest(?) cat and also the first cat we had.
His fur is addictingly (idk) and I always want to (flatter) him,
but he doesn't like to get picked up. However, recently,
he started to be way more friendly and, a lot of times,
wants to get (flatté), though he still doesn't like to be picked up.

He hates Pichu and even starts to be aggressive only by Pichu being able to be seen by him.
He constantly gets chased by him and, despite Timide constantly hissing,
Pichu doesn't stop.
