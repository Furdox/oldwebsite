ok uhhhhh idk yet
maybe lets figure out how things will apply / what the guidelines for css intergration is.

lets have a website core defining core website-wide elements
and a basic dark theme

then have the page specific css whithin the dir that has
the page specific elements

then have the selected theme or user theme.

And actually, while I think about it, maybe it would fit
better to actually have the website in a /website repo...
